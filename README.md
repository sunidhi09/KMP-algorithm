# KMP Algorithm Implementation in Python

## Overview
This project provides a Python implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, a powerful and efficient string searching technique. The KMP algorithm is designed to search for occurrences of a "pattern" string within a given "text" string with improved performance over naive string searching methods.

## Features
- **Efficient Search**: Utilizes the KMP algorithm to perform fast and efficient string matching.
- **LPS Array Construction**: Includes the construction of the Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array for pattern pre-processing.
- **User-Friendly**: The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users interested in string searching algorithms.

## How It Works
The KMP algorithm works in two main steps:
1. **Pre-processing**: Constructs the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array for the pattern string. The LPS array is used to skip unnecessary comparisons during the search.
2. **Searching**: Uses the LPS array to search the pattern within the text efficiently by skipping indices when a mismatch occurs.

## Installation
To use this implementation, you need to have Python installed on your machine. No external libraries are required.

## Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the KMP algorithm implementation:

```python
def KMP_search(pattern, text):
    # Implementation of the KMP Algorithm
    # ...

# Example usage
text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB"
pattern = "ABABCABAB"
KMP_search(pattern, text)
